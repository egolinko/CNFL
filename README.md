Code for Categorical to Numerical Feature Learning

The code in this doucment serves as the test code used for this methodology. Often we swap 'CNFL' and 'lwcd', this is an analog of 'learning with categorical data'. For any further clarification or discussion please contact egolinko@fau.edu. Thanks for checking this out.
